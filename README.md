# Marlin-Ender5-Pro

Custom Marlin Config Files for my Crealtiy Ender-5 Pro.

These are my configuration files for the Creality Ender 5 Pro for the Marlin Firmware.

Notes:

1. My Board is the Creatlity v4.2.2 with the GD327303RRET6 Chip and is not supported by Marlin.
2. My Board seems to use the TMC2909 Stepper Drivers.
3. I use the standard STM32F103RE_creality (512k) Environment for Auto Build Marlin.

Don't use this if you haven't gone throuth the Marlin Documentation and Understand what you are doing.
